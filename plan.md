Faculty of Computing Student Community (FCSC) Astro Website Requirements Document
Project Overview
The Faculty of Computing Student Community (FCSC) requires a modern, performant website built with Astro that will serve as a central digital hub for the student community. The website will allow FCSC executives to publish blogs, upload notices, take pre-orders for merchandise (via integration with a suitable backend or third-party service), and perform other administrative functions. Students should be able to access all content without requiring an account.
